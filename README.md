### About Me

I'm a Research Software Engineer at the Morgridge Institute for Discovery with collaboration with the University of Wisconsin - Madison. 

I'm currently a developer on the [Pelican Platform](https://github.com/PelicanPlatform/pelican).

My interests include machine learning and algorithm development. I'm currently looking to branch out into web-development as well.
